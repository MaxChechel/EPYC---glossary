After WWI and the defeat of states that searched for territorial expansion -- among other things -- the Versailles Peace Conference of 1919 devoted attention to the Minority rights necessary for the nationalities lacking a base for their protection. It had been the case that minority treatment was seen as a matter of the internal policies of a state. It was now becoming subject of international law. The League of Nations was to oversee the implementation of these treaties. Poland became the most exemplary treaty with 12 articles. The idea was to protect minorities not just in their civil, political, and religious freedoms that they may have obtained, but also, to offer ethnic and cultural protection for their difference within a state. Jews, par excellance, were a group defined as an extraterritorial minority and found these goals appealing. Many Jewish groups in Eastern and Western Europe welcomed and supported the goal of self-determination that Minority Treaties were offering. Unfortunately, their implementation in independent Poland between the Wars was delayed due to government-sanctioned anti-Semitism."

    "Kehillah": "(Kehillot, plural). The Kehillah, or Jewish Community Council, was an organization, which was initially set up in Eastern Europe for the purposes of taxation. Before the emergence of Modern states in Europe, there was no such thing as a 'citizen'. Individuals living in a country were not all treated the same and not accorded the same rights and privileges. Kings or noblemen who were rulers of particular areas would allow people to live on their land. Sometimes large groups of people, such as Jews, would request permission as a group to settle in a land. Oftentimes when Jews were permitted to settle in a place, they were required to pay a special community tax. The entire community would be responsible for the payment. The result was the emergence of a small council, which was responsible for collecting and paying the community tax. This council, the Kehillah, although initially set up to serve as the representative liaison between the secular ruler and the Jewish community, eventually evolved to serve as the leadership for the Jewish community with regard to its internal affairs. Thus, in addition to collecting taxes to be paid to the king or nobleman, the Kehillah might also collect taxes to pay the salary of the rabbi or to pay for the upkeep and maintenance of the mikvah. Because of this role, the Kehillah members made decisions about who should serve as rabbi or mikvah attendant. In addition, the Kehillah might take a broader role such as supervising kosher butchers or other duties. In the Russian empire, when the Tsar dictated that every community must send their youngsters to the army, it fell on the Kehillah to choose the army recruits from the community and to enforce other unwelcome edicts of the ruler. In some areas, the Kehillah became a sort of oligarchy where the same families automatically maintained power in the kehillah. The end of the kehillah primarily came with the granting of citizenship. Once Jews as individuals were members of a state, they were no longer compelled to use an official body to mediate between the state and the Jewish community. However, it was necessary for the Jewish community to maintain the synagogues, the mikvahs and other apparatus of Jewish life and for these purposes, a Jewish community council was still needed. In Poland, elected officials made up the new Kehillahs which maintained the synagogues, Jewish orphanages, homes for the elderly, mikvahs, and other communal support aparati. In the Soviet Union, the kehillah was persecuted as Jewish religious life was attacked and dismantled."

In the 19th century 6 cities were almost totally Jewish (Belz, Brody, Premyshlyany, Rogatin, Delyatin and Sokal). Galicia was also a center for Jewish thinking and activity: from Talmudic scholars, to Hasidic rebbes, to members of regional councils. 10 cities had Jewish mayors. In the 19th Century the Haskalah made inroads in Galicia and there was an assimilation trend that expressed itself either towards the Polish or Russian culture.

'Gaon of Vilna' (1720-1797) Rabbi Elijah ben Solomon Zalman, better known as the Vilna Gaon, stressed the necessity for immersion in Torah study as the only true path of religious life. A Mitnagdic icon, he saw the songs, stories, parables, and mysticism of the Hasidim as nothing more than stumbling blocks placed in front of the 'blind', preventing them from seeing the 'light'. In addition, the Gaon saw the Hasidic tradition of the Rebbe as idol-worship, aping the Christians by celebrating the qualities of a living man, rather than focusing on the glories of God.

    "Captain Alfred Dreyfus": "(1859-1935) On October 15, 1894, Captain Alfred Dreyfus, one of the few high ranking Jewish officers in the French Army, was arrested and falsely accused of having been a spy. In reality, it was a Major Esterhazy, a non-Jew who had been spying and it was later discovered that documents had been forged to frame Captain Dreyfus. French public opinion at that time held that Dreyfus must be guilty because he was a Jew. It was this attitude in what was supposed to be one of the most 'enlightened' and least anti-Semitic countries that severely upset Theodore Herzl and convinced him that anti-Semitism was so strong that the only answer for Jews was a Jewish State."

    "Bundist": "Abbr. in Yiddish for 'Algemeyner Yidisher Arbeter Bund in Lite, Poyln un Rusland'. The General Workers' Union was the Jewish Socialist party. Founded in 1897 in Vilna, it soon solidified its ideology: for autonomism, devoted to Yiddish language and culture, and secular nationalism. It proclaimed for Jews to live in 'Doykeit' (hereness), an ideological perspective that supported changes in the place where Jews had lived for a millenium. The Bund embraced three major groups: parts of the working class, the radical intelligentsia and the semi- intelligentsia, and those Jews that lacked sufficient general education but were steeped in Jewish culture. It took on formidable battles against the Zionists, but occasionally collaborated in educational efforts with the Poalei Tzion, a socialist and Yiddish-based Zionist party. It helped spread many educational institutions and organizations for adults and youth, as well as important training in self-defense."

Its goal was aliya to Eretz Israel, establishing a Jewish state on both sides of the Jordan river. Members of other Jewish movements derided Betar members as 'fascists' because of their reddish-brown shirts and militant stance."

    "Autonomy": "Term that designates some degree of self-government. Historically, Jews enjoyed a degree of it everywhere with the court system they always maintained, their own collection of taxes, etc. In Poland, the Jewish Council of Four Lands, (16th century) became the most comprehensive experiment of Jewish Autonomy within a foreign state. For minorities, the concept has relevance with respect to their cultural matters. A movement for cultural autonomy was developed by Jewish historian, Shimon Dubnov; this idea received much support and consideration after WW I with the Minorities Treaty. Other influential intellectuals that rallied the idea were Chaim Zhitlovsky of the Folkpartei, and Nathan Birnbaum. Autonomism was then a movement for minority rights, especially those pertaining to culture, language, and education."

    "Aliyah": "From the Hebrew 'ascent', aliya refers to the central tenet of many Jewish political movements -- beginning at the end of the 19th century in Eastern Europe -- aiming for the return of the Jewish people to their ancestral home. As a goal, it was part of all Zionist ideologies. Organized aliya started in the 1880, as a reaction to the Russian pogroms, led by a group known as Bilu. Despite difficulties with the Turkish authorities, this became known as aliya A, in which 25,000 Jews settled in Palestine. The second aliya (Bet) (1904-14) also derived from Russian Jewery; around 30-40,000 Jews settled then, many fueled by socialist ideals. The Balfour Declaration (1919) gave raise to the third aliya( 1919-1923)(Gimel). In this wave, youthful representation was prominent. The fourth wave of aliya (1924-1931) had its main source in Polish Jews. The fifth Aliya of the 30s started because of Nazi persecutions, and also saw the organization of Youth Aliya. At the end of this wave, there was a large 'illegal' group of immigrants, that found themselves with no papers officially sanctioning their travel. The sixth aliya, at the tail end of the war and after, include the stories of the ships like Exodus, Patria, Struma. In none of the waves that brought Jews to Israel, did they all remain settled there. However, by the time of the establishment of the State, there were approximately 750,000 Jews in Israel."
